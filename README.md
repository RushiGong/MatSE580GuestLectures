# MatSE580 Guest Lecture 1
This is the first of the two lectures I will give in Fall 2023 MatSE 580 (Computational Thermodynamics) at Penn State, which together should provide students with some basic skills in:
1. Manipulating and analyzing materials - using [pymatgen](https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen)
2. Setting up a small NoSQL database on the cloud to synchronize decentralized processing - using [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas) Free Tier
3. Interacting with the database and visualizing the results - using [pymongo](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-python-driver) library and [MongoDB Charts](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/charts/) service
4. Installing and running machine learning (ML) tools to predict stability of materials - using [pySIPFENN](https://pysipfenn.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and, if time allows, [ALIGNN](https://github.com/usnistgov/alignn)
5. Using ML featurization and dimensionality reduction to embed materials in feature space - using [pySIPFENN](https://pysipfenn.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) with [MongoDB Charts](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/charts/) visualization

The `Lecture1.ipynb` Jupyter notebook covers points 1, 3 (interaction part), 4 (install part). Points 2 and 3 (visualization part) will be done outside of this environment by student during the lecture.
